### Branching strategy: GitHub Flow
- Creating a separate GitHub repository for ech project. This will help maintain clear project
boundaries.
- Creating a new feature branch. When starting work on a new feature or bug fix, a branch will created from the main branch.

### Use of .gitignore file 
It will be used for:
- Specificity: Each project has its unique set of files that should be ignored, allowing for more precise control.
- Organization: Keeps the .gitignore file focused on the specific project, improving readability.
- Independence: Changes to one project's .gitignore don't affect other projects.

### Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Credentials and sensitive information is not to be committed directly to a GitHub Repository.
This is a critical security principle I must adhere to. Because exposing such information can lead to
severe consequences, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial loss.
